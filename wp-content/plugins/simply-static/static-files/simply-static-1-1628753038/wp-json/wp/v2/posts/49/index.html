A car is a high-involvement, high-cost purchase for most people, and it also reflects self-expression, so all of the interactions that surround it should reflect that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"84bb\">Augmented Reality now enables car buyers to view&nbsp;cars in 3D from all directions instead of physically going to see them. Consumers can now make nuanced decisions without having to leave the house by getting a realistic 360-degree view of a vehicle, both inside and out, as well as seeing how it drives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"691b\">Several car manufacturers have already adopted VR and AR technology. With research findings that 59% of consumers rely on personalisation to influence their purchasing decisions, the automotive industry like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Honda and Toyota capitalised these new strategies to create a more immersive experience for customers. These companies are now using Augmented Reality technology to showcase their cars in new and creative ways, anywhere and at any time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3adb\">\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c-\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc33 \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc11 \/ \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc11 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc31\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9648\">Mercedes-Benz is using Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality platform to help with its manufacturing operations, initiate corporate training as well as a sales revolution.
