It is drastically altering the economy and&nbsp;creating major disruptions in industries such as airlines, tourism, retail, transportation, and pharmaceutical. We saw how this virus wreaks havoc on the demand and supply chain. This is evident in people\u2019s changing behaviour, as they avoid public interaction, big gatherings, public transportation, restaurant flights, shopping malls, and so on. The traditional workplace is affected by this self-quarantine restriction. Coronavirus, on the other hand, has led to a worldwide boom in remote working. This is when creativity connects the whole world thereby preventing Coronavirus from affecting the workplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3bfc\">Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of people are forced to function remotely. The only question is whether these changes will last, or if we\u2019ll all return to the office once the virus is no longer a threat. Organizations are attempting to make use of the best teamwork methods, regardless of how long it takes for things to return to normal. Employees are currently interacting via conventional video-conferencing platforms However, there is another path for people to collaborate which is catching a lot of traction post pandemic, that is, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c743\">\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc03-\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfd7 \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d528\">\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25 &amp; \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"460e\">Prior to Covid-19, major retailers such as Amazon and Walmart dominated the online grocery industry, which was experiencing rapid growth. However, it only made up about 6% of the total grocery retail sector. Owing to isolation and quarantine as a result of the global Coronavirus outbreak, many people are unable to shop offline. However, this does not rule out the possibility of e-commerce firms communicating with their clients and consumers. Augmented reality is one of the few tools that can bring digital goods into live real spaces. In many cases AR is able to offer better visualization than actual objects in physical stores by enabling customers to see how those items will look and perform into their daily lives. There are several examples of AR being successfully integrated into digital shopping: For example, IKEA, a Swedish multinational, has already released an augmented reality catalogue app that allows you to see how different pieces of furniture will appear in your home; L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Sephora, the beauty companies have also embraced technology by developing apps that enable consumers to digitally try on makeup before buying it. Any physical product can be transformed into a virtual model and sold in a mobile augmented reality store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"5b28\">\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21 \ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4f79\">Augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality would have an effect on education in addition to the workplace, shopping, and online activities. Millions of students across the world who are unable to attend school or university are concerned that the present and potential lockdowns would have a negative impact on their education. Schools and colleges can implement tools that enable students to learn through interactions to ease students\u2019 concerns. The main advantages of AR and VR technologies in education are that they make learning more immersive and therefore more engaging. They can also incorporate gaming elements into textbook material. Platforms like virtual reality are expected to be the most useful tool.

It can attract medical professionals by supplying them with a variety of uses in the central field of healthcare and treatment. Virtual reality allows physicians and medical personnel to withstand and practice even the most complex situations by allowing them to reachability that is as close to real-world patient handling as possible. This help provides a more analogous atmosphere in which doctors and health workers can learn to treat problems of treatment and proper learning more efficiently and effectively. Some patients experience psychosomatic disturbances after being exposed to such high levels of pandemic pressure as COVID-19. In such situations, the VR approach can be extremely beneficial and important. Researchers, physicians, the government, and academicians will create a healthy environment to combat this disease if this strategy is properly implemented. The definition of virtual reality encompasses an overall improvement in the precision and effectiveness of adopted actions, increased working proficiency, well-trained medical staff, and other factors that can both efficiently and profitably help to handle the continuing pandemic COVID-19 cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1400\/1*Pqt3QGDCqA0PuBoK7Jlz9w.jpeg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"394c\">\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"68bf\">Virtual reality not only assists in the hunt for and destruction of coronavirus DNA, but they also assist in the alleviation of boredom and the suppression of their growing dread. Furthermore, virtual games that use virtual reality are more powerful than books. Because gaming became a way for people to bond socially during the pandemic, it\u2019s likely that it\u2019ll continue to be a social activity after it\u2019s over. Traditional sports franchises have also taken a note of e-success and gaming\u2019s major sporting competitions such as FIFA, NASCAR, and Formula 1 have been cancelled in order to uphold social distance norms, they are turning to e-games to keep their viewers engaged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e591\">Few more examples of how some companies have employed Virtual reality technology in the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The ancient stone town of Stamford Kiel in the Midland Plains of the United Kingdom offered free VR equipment to 9643 households in the city so that they could engage in community events at home during the epidemic, such as virtual bars, virtual libraries, Easter activities, and even collaborate with local restaurants.<\/li><li>HTC agreed to organize this year\u2019s developer conference online due to the outbreak, though it will still be held in virtual reality.
