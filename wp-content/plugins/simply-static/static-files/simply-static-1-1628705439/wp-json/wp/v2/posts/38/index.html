Just for example in the field of Engineering and Manufacturing, safety and operational training are being provided. Virtual tours of the factories, offices, are also provided using the VR in corporate training.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d8b3\">Even the&nbsp;<strong>soft skills&nbsp;<\/strong>don\u2019t show a lack in here as for the sales and customer support department are provided training for the betterment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"168d\">At&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.infivr.com\/\">InfiVR<\/a>, our team of professionals have been providing the best of help to the well-known brands, like, Toyota for Safety training, Swiggy for experiential and Safety Virtual training and a lot of&nbsp;<strong>soft-skill training<\/strong>&nbsp;help using the&nbsp;<strong>VR technology<\/strong>, at large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"664d\"><strong>Latest technology interventions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f893\">Trends of technology have been redefining the future in every field. In the past couple years drastic evolutions in the workplaces been seen because of the growing complexities. But we need to understand that talent is the main driving force behind the organisation\u2019s success and this is why, there is a need to understand, continuous evolution in the hiring and training is necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"52fd\">1. For better alignment of goals, HR and C-suite co-ordination. A lot more efforts can be seen in the coming years with the organisations planning and committing towards a better tech enabled and scalable learning culture and with the right coordination of HR and C-suite being followed, the same will help increase the performance and the<br>competencies of workers within.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e617\">2. Future organisational goals and development of competencies for same.<br>Management can be seen targeting the employees for future leadership goals. This will help maintain better health of the company. Both&nbsp;<strong>AI<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>VR<\/strong>&nbsp;are used herein as for training the employees for communication, leadership development and better problem-solving skills. New doors, this is what we can call for the current as well as the updated employees, who are guided towards a lead for future leaders, making them agile and capable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b534\">3. Communication skills emphasising for diverse broadening reach. There is a need for the development of the&nbsp;<strong>employee\u2019s soft skills<\/strong>, with the organisations broadening its reach.&nbsp;<strong>Emotional intelligence, negotiation, collaborations<\/strong>, all as a part of the same has been categorised of critical priority as it helps in leadership improvement and for providing meaningful culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"4226\">4. The&nbsp;<strong>Gamified training system<\/strong>&nbsp;is the right move towards the building of a progressive reward system. With all the badges, points, leader-board and the associated tools can be seen do drive in the passion while the learners who lack it, participate and await their core motivation to kick in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1769\">5. Training, the right bait for acquisition and benefit for employees. Organisations can be seen working towards the better training processes as employees are more attracted towards organisations providing professional as well as personal development. L&amp;D is a critical role player for engaging and retaining and to succeed, this one emerging trend concentrating upon training needs to be focused by all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2dd5\">6. A weightage can be put high upon&nbsp;<strong>learner-centric<\/strong>&nbsp;as against the content oriented training. It is hard to focus on one size for all and then engaging with the learner. There is a need as per the trend for training programs to zero in for learner concerning their&nbsp;<strong>experience, performance, fluency, etc.<\/strong>&nbsp;They must be able to provide a means for sharing experiences and this is how the organisations can evolve using this trend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bd42\">7. Digitally mobile contents delivery might be seen as critical than before. As for what research shows, talent development challenge comes in from getting employees to learn by making a little time. They might not agree upon to get the training by finding time in primary jobs. So, digitally mobile training will help them eliminate time crunch and help them evolve better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8582\">All these emerging trends will be a right hit (positively) for the business to succeed but only if they get through following the same, right on time and contacting the right value providers.
